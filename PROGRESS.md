# TateStudy Progress Log

## Work Completed Today (2025-10-24)

- Refactored sidebar navigation for a cleaner, modern look:
  - Removed radio and button navigation, replaced with custom-styled sidebar.
  - Sidebar now only shows a prominent "New Project" button and a "Recent Projects" section.
  - Improved sidebar spacing, layout, and text visibility (white text for contrast).
  - Ensured session state keys are always initialized to prevent KeyErrors.
  - Fixed sidebar navigation logic to ensure new projects appear immediately after creation.
  - Removed redundant sidebar elements ("Projects" navigation header).
- Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub with atomic commits.
- Validated UI/UX improvements and error fixes.

## Plans for Future Work

- Add persistent storage for projects (e.g., save/load projects to disk or database).
- Implement project editing (notes, flashcards, etc.) and deletion features.
- Integrate PDF upload and flashcard generation into the project creation workflow.
- Build out Quiz and Analytics tabs for each project:
  - Quiz: auto-generate quizzes from flashcards, track scores.
  - Analytics: show study progress, flashcard stats, quiz history.
- Add authentication/user accounts for personalized study sessions.
- Polish UI further (icons, color palette, responsive design, accessibility).
- Write and expand unit tests for new features.
- Document codebase and update README as features are added.
